While you have experienced poor appetite or overeating nearly every day and have moved or spoken slowly on several days, you do not report other key symptoms of depression such as persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbances, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, or thoughts of self-harm. Depression typically involves a combination of these symptoms that persist for at least two weeks and significantly impact daily functioning. However, if you have concerns about your mental health, it is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation."

The individual described exhibits several symptoms that align with major depressive disorder (MDD) as outlined in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). These symptoms include:  1. Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much nearly every day. 2. Poor appetite or overeating more than half the days. 3. Trouble concentrating on things several days. 4. Thoughts that he would be better off dead or of hurting himself nearly every day.  While he does not feel down, depressed, or hopeless, the presence of significant sleep disturbances, appetite changes, concentration issues, and recurrent thoughts of death or self-harm are strong indicators of depression. The presence of these symptoms, especially the thoughts of self-harm, warrants a diagnosis of depression and immediate professional intervention."

Psychomotor changes (moving or speaking slowly). 6. Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

Since you have not experienced other key symptoms such as fatigue, poor appetite, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, or suicidal thoughts, it is unlikely that you have depression based on the information provided.

While you have experienced some symptoms such as feeling tired, having poor appetite or overeating, and trouble concentrating, these symptoms alone do not necessarily indicate depression. Depression typically involves a persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest in activities, along with other symptoms that significantly impact daily functioning. Since you have not felt down, depressed, or hopeless, and have not experienced a loss of interest or pleasure in doing things, it is unlikely that you have depression. However, if you are concerned about your symptoms, it is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation."

Additionally, the symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. In this case, she has not felt down, depressed, or hopeless, and she does not have enough symptoms to meet the full criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.

Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day. 4. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 5. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day. 6. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day. 7. Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation.  The woman has experienced most of these symptoms nearly every day for the past two weeks, which suggests she may be suffering from depression.
