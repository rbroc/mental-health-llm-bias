"Over the past two weeks, my life has unfolded in a predictable rhythm, yet it teeters on the edge of subtle complexity. For me, life is a tapestry woven with neither interest nor pleasure in everyday activities. It's not that I feel down, depressed, or hopeless; instead, an inexplicable neutrality colors everything. Sleep comes effortlessly. I fall asleep easily, stay asleep, and never sleep excessively. My energy levels remain stable, leaving me neither tired nor lethargic. Yet, an inconsistency lingers in my appetite. Nearly every day, I struggle with eating, sometimes consuming too little and at other times too much. Despite these fluctuations, my self-perception remains intact and untarnished. I never feel like a failure or believe I have disappointed myself or my family. Concentration is a constant companion, as reading the newspaper or watching television poses no difficulties.

My appetite has fluctuated dramatically, with some days passing without the desire to eat and others consumed by overeating. More troubling, pervasive feelings of inadequacy have crept in, as I believe I have let myself or my family down more days than not. Amidst these struggles, my concentration remains intact.

Whether it was trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or oversleeping, restfulness eluded me on several occasions. Nearly every day, fatigue weighed heavily on me, sapping my energy and motivation. The struggle with appetite further complicated matters; some days, eating felt like an afterthought, while on others, it became difficult to resist overeating. This cycle of opposing forces left me grappling with feelings of inadequacy. More than half the time, thoughts of failure crept in, convincing me that I had somehow let myself or my family down. Remarkably, amidst this turmoil, concentration never became an issue. I could still engage with reading the newspaper or watching television without difficulty. However, the outer world seemed to move at a different pace. Nearly every day, others noticed my slow, deliberate movements and speech that hinted at a deeper struggle within. Although not a daily occurrence, some days brought darker thoughts, where I imagined life would be simpler without me.

"Over the past two weeks, I have found little joy in activities that once brought me happiness. Surprisingly, my mood has never dipped into depression or hopelessness, yet sleep has become elusive or excessively abundant almost every night. Fatigue remains absent, as my energy levels have inexplicably stayed constant. Nonetheless, I battle with a fluctuating appetite, often eating too little or too much on most days. Thoughts of self-doubt and feelings of being a failure steadily weave themselves into my mind, casting a shadow of disappointment that lands heavily on my personal and familial expectations. Despite this, my concentration has never wavered, allowing me to engage with reading and television without difficulty.

Each day seems to drain me of energy, leaving exhaustion in place of vitality. Meals offer little solace, as I experience a fluctuating appetite, eating too little or overeating on more days than not. A persistent feeling of inadequacy haunts me, a deep-seated belief that I am a failure or have disappointed myself and my family. Concentration has become elusive, turning simple tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television into daunting challenges on most days.

Sleep brings no respite; trouble falling or staying asleep haunts me, with some nights giving way to excessive sleep that fails to rejuvenate. Nearly every day, fatigue clings like an unwelcome shadow, draining my energy and making even minor tasks seem insurmountable. Yet, amidst these struggles, my appetite remains stable, neither succumbing to poor appetite nor falling into overeating patterns. Remarkably, I do not harbor feelings of worthlessness or failure, resisting the harsh judgment that sometimes accompanies such difficult times. Concentration proves elusive as well, with thoughts often straying during attempts to read the newspaper or watch television. The pace of my movements and speech sometimes slows, noticeable enough for others to see, on some days.

My nights have been restless, marked by trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or, on certain occasions, oversleeping. Fatigue has become a constant companion, enveloping my days with a veil of tiredness and low energy. My appetite has become erratic, swinging from poor to excessive more than half the days, adding to my physical discomfort. A stream of self-critical thoughts has woven its way into my mind, fostering feelings of inadequacy and self-reproach, surfacing more than half the days.

Sleep, however, remained a constant; whether it was falling asleep or staying asleep, I faced no challenge there, yet waking hours were often marked by a pervasive weariness that settled heavily on my shoulders. Despite maintaining a regular appetite, a nagging feeling of inadequacy and self-reproach plagued my thoughts, as though an inaudible whisper continually reminded me of perceived failures. Engaging in straightforward tasks like reading a newspaper or watching a television show became daunting, my mind wandering and drifting with disconcerting frequency. Nearly every day, my movements were noticeably slow, as if burdened by an invisible weight, occasionally drawing concerned glances from those around me.

This sense of failure looms large almost daily, casting a shadow over every endeavor. My concentration wanes, making it difficult to stay focused on reading the newspaper or watching television on several days, yet the external world remains largely oblivious to this internal struggle, as my movements and speech remain unaffected by the weight of these emotions.

Despite these challenges, I managed to maintain a sense of self-worth, never succumbing to feelings of failure or disappointment in myself or in relation to family expectations. Even so, I battled fatigue, seemingly drained of energy on more than half of these days.

However, food has become an inconsistent comfort for me, with days marked by either a poor appetite or bouts of overeating, reflecting my tumultuous inner state. I have frequently felt plagued by self-doubt, often considering myself a failure or believing I have let down my family. Concentration has been a nearly impossible feat, with even straightforward tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television requiring tremendous effort and focus.

"Over the past two weeks, I have been struggling with an overwhelming sense of despondency. More than half the days, I find no interest or pleasure in activities that once brought me joy. Almost every day, an oppressive weight of feeling down, depressed, or utterly hopeless clings to me, casting a shadow over all aspects of my life. Sleep eludes me as well, with nights spent tossing and turning or, at times, oversleeping in an attempt to escape the relentless fatigue. I wake feeling more drained than rested. It seems that more than half the days, energy is a scarce resource, leaving me weary and worn. Food, too, has lost its normal rhythm. I swing between a lack of appetite and moments of overeating, each extreme troubling me more than half the days. Each reflection in the mirror only deepens the conviction that I am a failure, letting down myself and, perhaps more painfully, my family. Nearly every day, self-reproach and guilt loop relentlessly in my mind. Concentration has become almost impossible for me. Once simple tasks, like reading the newspaper or watching television, often slip beyond reach as my focus fractures time and again. Though I have never moved or spoken so slowly that it would draw others' attention, the drag of despair is painfully evident within. Several days have been particularly dark, with thoughts creeping in that I might be better off dead or thoughts of self-harm disturbing my fragile peace.

Sleep has become a battleground for me, with troubles falling asleep or staying asleep, and then on other nights, sleeping far too much, never finding a restful balance. Each day, I have felt an overwhelming fatigue and a lack of energy, making even the simplest tasks feel insurmountable. My relationship with food has wavered between poor appetite and overeating, neither bringing comfort or satisfaction. A sense of self-doubt has plagued me, as feelings of failure and disappointment creep in several days. I wrestle with the notion of having let myself or my family down, struggling to find worth or purpose. Concentration slips through my fingers like sand, turning reading the newspaper or watching television into daunting tasks. On many days, my movements and speech come slowly, a heaviness noticed by others, as if I am wading through a thick fog.

The activities that once brought me delight have become burdensome, leaving me trudging through each day with a heavy heart. More often than not, a sense of being downcast or dispirited clouds my mind, giving rise to an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness. Nights have become battles with sleeplessness or an excess of sleep, with rest offering little respite. Awakening brings no renewal of energy, only a persistent fatigue that clings relentlessly. Despite this lack of vigor, I have not strayed from my eating patterns, avoiding the pitfalls of poor appetite or indulgence. A deep sense of self-doubt plagues my thoughts, whispering notions of inadequacy and failure. The burden of feeling that I have disappointed myself or my loved ones is a constant companion, echoing in my mind almost every day. Surprisingly, I have maintained clarity in concentrating on tasks at hand, whether perusing a newspaper or losing myself in a television show. However, a noticeable lethargy in movement and speech has emerged, creeping into my daily interactions at a pace discernible to others.

This persistent state of mind has seeped into the night, making restful sleep elusive. Whether I'm struggling to fall asleep or staying trapped under the weight of sleep for too long, the nights have offered little reprieve. Throughout this period, I have experienced fluctuations in appetite, swinging between having a poor appetite to overeating almost daily. A deep sense of self-doubt has taken root, leading me to feel like a failure — as if I've let myself or my family down almost every day. Despite this inner turmoil, my ability to concentrate has remained unaffected. Tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television have not posed any challenges to my focus. In this state of low energy, I have moved and spoken slower than usual, to the point where others may have noticed.

Nearly every day has felt like a repeated cycle of disinterest, where even routine tasks seem burdensome. Many days have been colored by feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless, casting a shadow over any fleeting moments of lightheartedness. Despite my consistent struggles with emotional well-being, sleep has remained a reliable constant — rarely disrupted, never excessive. Yet, waking each morning, I have more often than not faced the day with a sense of fatigue and low energy, as if walking through life with a constant weight bearing down. My appetite has been erratic; on some days, I eat too little, feeling no hunger, while on others, there is a tendency to overeat, perhaps seeking comfort where none can be found. I often wrestle with feelings of low self-esteem, plagued by thoughts of being a failure or feeling that I have let down myself or my family. Concentration has been elusive — tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television, once simple pleasures or distractions, now require tremendous effort. There are times when the world seems to move at a different pace, or perhaps it is me who has slowed, moving or speaking in a manner noticeably different than before.

The usual pleasures that once brought me joy and excitement have lost their luster, leaving a vast emptiness in their wake. More often than not, I have grappled with feelings of being down, a lingering sense of depression and hopelessness settling in like an unwelcome guest that refuses to leave. Sleep offers no solace, as restless nights blur into days filled with fatigue. Each morning, I wake from a sleep that is either fitful or excessive, yet neither brings the energy I desperately need. My appetite, too, has become unpredictable; some days food is an afterthought, while on others it becomes a refuge from the gnawing emptiness. 

Despite knowing my worth, an inner voice whispers cruel reminders of failure and inadequacy nearly every day. The belief that I have let down my loved ones or myself looms large, casting long shadows over any flicker of self-assurance. Everyday tasks, simple activities like reading a newspaper or following a television program, demand a concentration that feels unattainable. In the quiet moments, my movements seem sluggish, the weight of the world translating into every step and word. It's as if time has slowed around me, yet the world continues its hurried pace, noticing the stark difference. On several days, darker thoughts have surfaced, unbidden and unwelcome, hinting at the notion that perhaps life would be easier if I no longer had to face it.

Although feelings of depression or hopelessness never took hold, sleep became elusive, with nights either too restless or consumed by an overbearing heaviness that led to oversleeping. My energy felt constantly drained, as if vitality was a distant memory, and the rhythm of life slowed almost perceptibly. Food, once a source of enjoyment, turned into an erratic necessity; some days passed with little appetite, while others were marked by excessive indulgence. Yet through this undulating course, I never struggled with self-esteem or feelings of failure, maintaining a steady confidence in my self-worth and family bonds. Despite the ebb of energy, mental clarity remained sharp, allowing focus to cut through fatigue without faltering during quiet moments of reading or watching television. However, the pace of movement and speech involuntarily slackened, as if each word and gesture weighed more heavily, prompting a few concerned glances from others. Beneath my calm exterior, a troubling undercurrent flowed.

Sleep has become a fickle companion, either remaining elusive through long, restless nights or overstaying its welcome in endless hours of slumber. I wake up more exhausted than refreshed, drained of energy and motivation. My appetite fluctuates wildly, swinging between eating barely enough to sustain my strength and consuming food with little restraint as though to fill a void. Every day brings a haunting chorus of self-criticism, with thoughts of inadequacy and failure echoing constantly. I feel as though my personal shortcomings have affected not just my own life but have also let my family down, causing continuous guilt and regret.

More than half of these days, feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless overshadow my once bright outlook on the future. I struggle with sleep, unable to fall or stay asleep, while on other nights, sleep seems endless. The energy I once had is now a distant memory, replaced by a persistent exhaustion that lingers more often than not. Eating has become a chore; sometimes, I have no appetite, while other times, I overeat to fill the void. Each day, I confront feelings of inadequacy, often believing that I have failed not only personally but also let down my family. My concentration wavers, turning simple tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television into monumental challenges.

A deep-seated sense of inadequacy gnawed constantly at me, leaving me feeling like a failure and a source of disappointment to myself and my family. Concentration proved elusive, whether attempting to read the newspaper or simply watch television, my mind scattered and unfocused on more than half of the days. In this slow march through time, even my movement and speech seemed to falter, enough for those around me to take notice during those several struggling days.

Each morning, I awoke to a world steeped in gray, the thought of engaging with the day ahead devoid of allure or joy. The feeling of despondency settled in like an unwelcome guest, whispering a litany of hopelessness that echoed in the corners of my mind nearly every day. The nights offered little respite, as sleep became a capricious companion. I lay awake, thoughts swirling, drifting into slumber only to awaken too soon, or sometimes retreating into sleep's embrace for far longer than intended. Fatigue clung to me, a constant reminder of the energy that once fueled passions and pursuits now diminished to mere embers. Eating became either a neglected necessity or an overzealous escape, as my appetite betrayed its natural rhythm. Guilt and self-reproach carved deep furrows in my heart, each day burdened by the heavy cloak of perceived failure, convinced that family and personal expectations lay shattered at my feet. Concentration eluded me, words on a page or scenes on a screen fading into an indistinct blur of disinterest. Movements and words slowed as if submerged in a viscous malaise, drawing curious glances or worried inquiries from those around. Yet, it was the pervasive, haunting notion—the fleeting, dangerous belief that all might be simpler without existence—that loomed most ominously.

Despite these challenges, you managed to maintain a sense of self-worth, never succumbing to feelings of failure or disappointment in yourself or in relation to family expectations. Even so, you battled fatigue, seemingly drained of energy on more than half of these days. Appetite issues added another layer to the struggle, swinging between having too little desire to eat and bouts of overeating. Concentration proved difficult—whether it was reading the newspaper or attempting to enjoy a television program, focus was fleeting, slipping away just when it seemed within reach. Yet, throughout this turbulent time, you actively resisted any outward manifestations of despair, never moving or speaking in a way that might cause others to worry. However, the most troubling aspect of this journey was the recurrent intrusion of thoughts suggesting everything might be easier if you were no longer alive, a daily torment that required immense inner strength to confront and navigate.",3,1,1,2,1,0,1,0,3,12,Moderate,you,second,narrative

Sleep has been elusive, slipping away just when exhaustion finally overcomes you. Some nights are restless and interrupted, while on other days, oversleeping becomes all too easy, as if trying to escape the waking world. Fatigue has settled into your bones, a constant companion that saps energy and dims enthusiasm. Eating has become erratic; some days, food is scarce on your list, and on others, it feels like a void needs to be filled. You can't shake off the persistent self-doubt, the nagging thought that failure lurks around every corner, waiting to confirm your fear of letting down everyone who matters. Concentration has turned into a herculean effort. Tasks that once required a moment's thought now drift beyond your grasp, like reading a newspaper article or following a television show. Yet, through all of this, you maintain a steady pace, never slowing to a point where others might notice a change, never contemplating that the world might be better off without your presence.

Despite these struggles, you remain physically energetic, with no feelings of fatigue to speak of. Your appetite has stayed consistent; neither poor nor ravenous. Nearly every day, an internal dialogue of self-criticism and perceived failure haunts you, casting doubts on your self-worth and causing emotional pain.

The belief that you have let down loved ones or yourself looms large, casting long shadows over any flicker of self-assurance. Everyday tasks, simple activities like reading a newspaper or following a television program, demand a concentration that feels unattainable. In the quiet moments, your movements seem sluggish, the weight of the world translating into every step and word. It's as if time has slowed around you, yet the world continues its hurried pace, noticing the stark difference.

Although feelings of depression or hopelessness never take hold, sleep becomes elusive, with nights either too restless or consumed by an overbearing heaviness that leads to oversleeping. Your energy feels constantly drained, as if vitality is a distant memory, and the rhythm of life slows almost perceptibly. Food, once a source of enjoyment, turns into an erratic necessity; some days pass with little appetite, while others are marked by excessive indulgence.

Despite the ebb of energy, mental clarity remains sharp, allowing you to focus and cut through fatigue without faltering during quiet moments of reading or watching television. However, the pace of your movement and speech involuntarily slackens, as if each word and gesture weighs more heavily, prompting a few concerned glances from others. Beneath your calm exterior, a troubling undercurrent flows.

More often than not, an oppressive cloud of sadness and hopelessness lingers, wrapping him in its embrace and refusing to let go. As night falls, the struggle continues. Sleep, which should offer respite, becomes a battle in itself—whether in the form of restless nights, marked by tossing and turning, or the unshakeable heaviness of oversleeping. Despite the abundance of rest or lack thereof, he finds energy elusive, with fatigue settling in like a constant companion. Some days come with an additional burden—the burden of self-doubt and guilt. On those days, the weight of past actions and perceived failures feels crushing, as if he has disappointed not only himself but also those around him. Tasks that necessitate focus become daunting challenges, as concentration ebbs and flows like an unreliable tide. The simple joy of reading a newspaper or following a television show fades, leaving in its place a frustrating haze. With time, even the pace of movement and speech becomes an unwitting reflection of the internal struggle, slowing to a point where the change is perhaps apparent to others. Yet amidst this emotional and mental turbulence, one constant remains: he has never entertained the thought of self-harm or escaping life entirely.

Nights have been restless, with sleep proving elusive or overwhelming, as the struggle to either fall asleep or stay asleep marks nearly every day. This fatigue seeps into daily life, where energy seems to wane, casting a shadow over the days. He finds that maintaining a balanced appetite is another battle—oscillating between eating too little and overeating on more than half the days. A nagging inner voice criticizes constantly, making him feel inadequate, like a failure who has disappointed himself or his family during this time. Concentration, once a steadfast companion, now feels like a distant memory, making simple tasks like reading a newspaper or watching television challenging on several days. The outside world notices subtle changes; movements slowed, words coming more deliberately, marking nearly every day with this unusual pace. In the midst of these struggles, he has encountered troubling thoughts, wondering if being alive holds less promise than it should.

Fatigue has settled in, draining energy and making even the simplest of tasks seem insurmountable. Strangely enough, his appetite has remained unchanged, neither dulled by disinterest nor exacerbated by emotional tumult. Nearly every day, he has wrestled with feelings of inadequacy and self-reproach, feeling as if everything he attempts falls short, leading to the perception of being a failure.

Alongside these struggles, appetite swings cause her to either eat sparingly or overindulge, reflecting an internal turmoil. Her self-esteem suffers greatly, with nearly every day marred by feelings of inadequacy and guilt, as though she has failed both her personal standards and familial expectations. Her concentration wanes noticeably, impairing her ability to engage with simple activities like reading the newspaper or watching television. Physical lethargy manifests outwardly, with her movements and speech slowing down enough for others to notice on more than half the days. Meanwhile, dark thoughts intrude upon her mind, suggesting that life might be better off without her or entertaining the notion of self-harm on more than half the days, painting a stark picture of the internal battles she is facing.",2,1,3,0,1,3,2,2,2,16,Moderately Severe,she,third,narrative
"Over the past two weeks, she has found the usual joys of life slipping away, with little interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed. Each day has weighed heavily, with feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless casting a lingering shadow. Nights have become challenging, either marked by restless hours struggling to fall or stay asleep, or by sinking into too much sleep. This persistent fatigue has drained her of energy, making each day feel like an uphill battle. Eating has also turned into a difficult task, with a fluctuating appetite that has swung between eating too little and overeating. The mirror reflects a harsh critic, as nearly every day is colored by feelings of self-doubt, as if she is a failure or has let down both herself and her family. Despite these mental heavyweights, she has retained focus when reading a newspaper or watching television, a small island of concentration amid the storm. However, she has moved or spoken with such unusual slowness that others have likely noticed, a visual echo of the internal struggle. More troubling, thoughts of being better off dead or of self-harm have visited more than half the days, casting a profound darkness over the brighter moments of life.

Sleep has become elusive, with restlessness and disruptions serving as constant companions, while other days bring an overpowering urge to sleep too much. She has often battled a sense of fatigue, drained of energy, and has alternated between having a poor appetite and overeating more than half the days. In moments of reflection, she has felt a deep sense of inadequacy, as if having failed personally or let her family down—a sentiment that has been prevalent on many days. Despite this heaviness, concentration has not faltered, and she has remained focused on tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television. The physical manifestation of this internal struggle has shown in slow movements and speech, noticeable to others nearly every day.

Sleep has been elusive, either with trouble falling or staying asleep, or the opposite—sleeping too much. She finds it difficult to muster energy, feeling tired and listless on several occasions. Meals have become a challenge, as a poor appetite alternates with periods of overeating almost daily. Thoughts have turned inward, with her feeling overwhelmed by a sense of personal failure, questioning self-worth, and feeling like a disappointment to family. Despite this, concentration has remained intact—reading the newspaper or watching television has not posed a problem. Yet, movement and speech have slowed, noticeable to others nearly every day, hinting at the internal struggle within. Perhaps most concerning, thoughts of being better off dead or self-harm have surfaced more than half the days, pressing in like a persistent fog that clouds the mind.

The weight of feeling down, depressed, and hopeless frequently presses heavily on her shoulders, making the simple act of facing a new day seem arduous. Sleep has eluded her, as she finds it difficult to either fall or stay asleep; on other days, she sleeps too much. Yet despite the hours spent with her eyes closed, she wakes up feeling perpetually tired and lacking energy. It's a struggle just to get through a single day, and she often feels too weary to engage with the world around her. The challenge of maintaining a steady appetite has also been present nearly every day. Occasionally, she loses all interest in food, but at other times finds comfort in overeating, unable to establish a nurturing balance. Almost every day, an overwhelming wave of guilt and self-criticism crashes over her. The belief that she is a failure or a disappointment to herself and to loved ones ebbs and flows, but it is a constant, unwelcome companion. Concentration has become elusive, turning once-simple tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television into daunting endeavors. At times, she moves or speaks so slowly that others might notice, though the sluggish pace is one more reminder of feeling out of sync with the world.

Interestingly, she has maintained normal energy levels, never feeling unusually tired or drained.

"Over the past two weeks, she has been caught in a web of darkness and despair, feeling little interest or pleasure in activities that once brought joy. Each day has been a struggle, as feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless weigh heavily, consuming more than half of the days. She has found sleep to be elusive, with nights spent tossing and turning or sleeping too much, rendering the morning light almost unwelcome. Fatigue clings persistently, making it difficult to summon the energy needed for daily tasks, while appetite swings wildly between non-existence and overindulgence. Self-doubt has become an unwelcome companion, whispering harsh judgments that cast her as a failure who has let down herself and her family. Concentration proves fleeting, as attempts to read a newspaper or watch television are frequently interrupted by a wandering mind. Movement and speech have taken on a deliberate slowness, noticeable even to those around, reflecting her internal turmoil. Dark thoughts have surfaced nearly every day, haunting her with the notion that perhaps life would be better left behind.

"Over the past two weeks, she has wandered through life with a heavy heart, a nearly constant companion every day. Engulfed in a fog of disinterest, she finds no pleasure in activities that once brought joy. Slumber has become a fleeting stranger, with her struggling to fall asleep, stay asleep, or at times, sleeping far too much. Exhaustion grips her tightly, draining energy to the point where even basic tasks feel Herculean. Mealtime offers no respite; a poor appetite leaves her picking at food, or alternatively, seeking comfort in overeating. In quiet moments, an inner voice whispers feelings of failure, convincing her that she has disappointed herself and her family. Concentration slips from her grasp like sand through fingers, making reading the newspaper or watching television a challenging endeavor. Although her outward movements and speech remain unchanged to others, concealing the inner turmoil, thoughts of despair have crept in with unsettling persistence.

"Over the past two weeks, she has grappled with a weight that makes everyday life feel insurmountable more than half the days. She finds little interest or pleasure in activities that once brought joy, often feeling down, depressed, or even hopeless. The struggle extends into the nights, where she faces a relentless battle with sleep, either unable to fall or stay asleep or trapped in slumber for too long nearly every day. 

Each morning, she wakes, but the exhaustion remains, a constant companion that drains energy nearly every day. Mealtimes bring no relief; she wrestles with a poor appetite or the opposite, eating too much, feeling out of control several days a week. Despite these challenges, she maintains a sense of self-worth and never believes in being a failure or letting herself or her family down—a small but bright thread holding her together. However, she struggles to concentrate, whether it's on a simple task like reading the newspaper or trying to follow a storyline on television, confusion overshadowing clarity nearly every day. The physical manifestations of the turmoil are evident as she moves or speaks slowly, noticeable to others nearly every day.

Nearly every day, an oppressive mood has shaded her outlook, painting the world in tones of gray. Nights have proved equally challenging, with restless thoughts preventing restful sleep and leading to days filled with fatigue and drained energy. She has faced the ebb and flow of appetite, some days finding food undesirable and other days overeating in search of comfort. The mirror has often reflected a person filled with self-doubt—a belief that she has failed in some unseen but important way, whether in personal achievements or in fulfilling family expectations. Despite these turbulent emotions, an important boundary remains clear: no thoughts have crossed her mind about needing an escape as extreme as self-harm. Efforts to focus on simple tasks, like reading the newspaper or watching television, have felt like monumental challenges, her mind wandering far afield. In interactions, her movements and speech have slowed, an unintentional signal to those around that something deeply internal is awry.

Nights have proven difficult, as she has battled between an inability to fall asleep or stay asleep and sleeping far too much, only to wake up still tired and devoid of energy.

Each morning, she awoke to a world steeped in gray, the thought of engaging with the day ahead devoid of allure or joy. The feeling of despondency settled in like an unwelcome guest, whispering a litany of hopelessness that echoed in the corners of her mind nearly every day. The nights offered little respite, as sleep became a capricious companion. She lay awake, thoughts swirling, drifting into slumber only to awaken too soon, or sometimes retreating into sleep's embrace for far longer than intended. Fatigue clung to her, a constant reminder of the energy that once fueled passions and pursuits now diminished to mere embers. Eating became either a neglected necessity or an overzealous escape, as her appetite betrayed its natural rhythm. Guilt and self-reproach carved deep furrows in her heart, each day burdened by the heavy cloak of perceived failure, convinced that family and personal expectations lay shattered at her feet. Concentration eluded her, words on a page or scenes on a screen fading into an indistinct blur of disinterest. Movements and words slowed as if submerged in a viscous malaise, drawing curious glances or worried inquiries from those around.

Throughout many days, she struggled with a pervasive tiredness that seemed to seep into the bones, making simple tasks feel monumental. Meals were no refuge; her appetite was as inconsistent as her mood, swinging from barely touching food to mindlessly overeating. Each day felt like a fresh inventory of self-doubt, where she grappled with feelings of inadequacy and failure that stemmed from within and reached into family expectations. Concentration became a rare visitor, slipping away when attempting to read a newspaper or follow a storyline on television.
