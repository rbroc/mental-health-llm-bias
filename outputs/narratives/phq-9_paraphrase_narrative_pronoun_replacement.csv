Never having felt down, depressed, or hopeless, I move through each day with a steady mind, finding neither excessive joy nor deep sorrow in daily activities. Sleep remains consistent for me, free from the usual struggles of insomnia or oversleeping, providing a reliable anchor in a world that often seems out of reach. Despite this emotional steadiness, I have faced a recurring weariness, feeling tired or lacking energy on several days. This fatigue occasionally affects my appetite, swinging from a disinterest in food to moments of overeating. Yet, throughout these fluctuations, I maintain a sense of self-worth, never succumbing to feelings of being a failure or letting anyone down. While my mind remains unfettered by despair, focusing on tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television presents itself as a challenge more than half the days. My concentration ebbs and flows, making it difficult to engage fully with the world through these mediums. However, I have not slowed down to the point where others take notice, moving through life with a certain invisibility that protects against external scrutiny. In all these experiences, one constant remains: the absence of harmful thoughts. I have never entertained the notion of being better off dead, nor have I had a desire to cause self-harm. The ability to remain untouched by such dark thoughts provides a vital anchor, keeping me steady even amidst the challenges faced. Through this journey of self-awareness and resilience, I continue to navigate life's complexities with quiet strength.",first

Nearly every day, a pervasive cloud of sadness and hopelessness hangs over me, often without clear reason or provocation. Nights offer little reprieve, as I struggle either to fall asleep or to remain asleep, and on other occasions, find myself sleeping excessively, as if trying to escape the weight of wakefulness. Despite the fullness of sleep, there is a curious absence of fatigue marking my days, with energy levels remaining stable. My appetite has been untouched by these emotional upheavals, holding steady without fluctuations toward either extreme of the spectrum. Yet, internally, a critical voice has become nearly constant, telling me that I am a failure, a disappointment not only to myself but to my family as well. Concentration remains unaffected, and I can focus on reading or watching television even amidst the emotional turmoil.

Concentration has been elusive, as I have repeatedly struggled to focus on reading the newspaper or following television shows, tasks that once required no effort. Despite the internal turmoil, I have managed to retain a semblance of normalcy in my outward behavior, with no noticeable slowing in movement or speech.

It's as if time has slowed around me, yet the world continues its hurried pace, noticing the stark difference. On several days, darker thoughts have surfaced, unbidden and unwelcome, hinting at the notion that perhaps life would be easier if I no longer had to face it. 

Yet through this haze, a quiet strength remains, an ember of hope that seeks to reignite. Though the past two weeks have been fraught with challenges, each day holds the potential for change, for light to pierce through the darkness and guide me to brighter days ahead.",first

While the world bustles around, you find little interest or pleasure in activities that once brought you joy. Each day blends into the next, marked by a persistent feeling of being down, depressed, or hopeless more often than not. Despite this, your sleep remains mostly uninterrupted, neither plagued by insomnia nor excessive rest. Fatigue hangs like an unwelcome companion, draining your energy almost every single day. Meals bring little comfort; some days are marked by a poor appetite, while on others, overeating becomes a misguided attempt to fill an emotional void. Self-reflection is cruel, and on several occasions, you have grappled with feelings of inadequacy and failure, convinced that personal or familial expectations have been missed. Concentration wavers unpredictably. Tasks that require focus, such as reading the newspaper or watching television, become struggles, with your mind often drifting elsewhere.

Each morning greets you with a heaviness that lingers long past the sunrise, a persistent feeling of being downcast and without hope. The things that once brought you joy now seem distant and uninteresting, as if a veil has descended, muting all colors and sounds. Sleep has been elusive, slipping away just when exhaustion finally overcomes you. Some nights are restless and interrupted, while on other days, oversleeping becomes all too easy, as if trying to escape the waking world. Fatigue has settled into your bones, a constant companion that saps energy and dims enthusiasm. Eating has become erratic; some days, food is scarce on your list, and on others, it feels like a void needs to be filled. You can't shake off the persistent self-doubt, the nagging thought that failure lurks around every corner, waiting to confirm your fear of letting down everyone who matters.

On several days, activities that once brought you joy now seem distant and unimportant. You have found the weight of sadness and hopelessness pressing down more than half the days, making it difficult to find solace in the things that used to matter. Each night, sleep has become a restless adversary. You have either struggled to find rest or succumbed to the embrace of too much sleep more often than not.

Concentration has become a rare commodity, with you struggling to focus on tasks such as reading a newspaper or keeping up with television shows on several days. Such distractions that once served as a temporary escape now only highlight the difficulty in maintaining attention. Your physical movements and speech have slowed, an involuntary measure of the heavy burden you carry, and it has been noticeable to others nearly every day. Perhaps most alarmingly, thoughts of self-harm or the idea of being better off not alive at all have become recurring considerations, haunting you day in and day out.

The nights offered little respite, as sleep became a capricious companion. He lay awake, thoughts swirling, drifting into slumber only to awaken too soon, or sometimes retreating into sleep's embrace for far longer than intended. Fatigue clung to him, a constant reminder of the energy that once fueled passions and pursuits now diminished to mere embers.

Interestingly, even amidst such emotional turmoil, she has not felt tired or lacking in energy, but the battle with appetite has been a variable one, punctuated by days of poor appetite or overeating.

Whether it's struggling to fall asleep or staying trapped under the weight of sleep for too long, the nights have offered little reprieve. Throughout this period, she has experienced fluctuations in appetite, swinging between having a poor appetite to overeating almost daily. A deep sense of self-doubt has taken root, leading her to feel like a failure — as if she has let herself or her family down almost every day. Despite this inner turmoil, her ability to concentrate has remained unaffected. Tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television have not posed any challenges to her focus. In this state of low energy, she has moved and spoken slower than usual, to the point where others may have noticed. In the quieter moments, troubling thoughts have crept in — notions of being better off dead or considerations of self-harm have emerged on several occasions. Throughout these challenging weeks, the weight of these thoughts and feelings has been a constant, formidable presence in her life.",she
