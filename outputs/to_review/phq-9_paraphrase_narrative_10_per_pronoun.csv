"Over the past two weeks, this person has had little interest or pleasure in doing things more than half the days. This person has felt down, depressed, or hopeless more than half the days. This person has had trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much more than half the days. This person has felt tired or having little energy several days. This person has had poor appetite or overeaten nearly every day. This person has felt bad about themselves — or that this person is a failure or has let themselves or their family down nearly every day. This person has had trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television several days. This person has moved or spoken so slowly that other people could have noticed several days. This person has never had thoughts that this person would be better off dead or of hurting themselves in some way.","Over the past two weeks, this person has found the world increasingly gray and uninviting. More than half the days, little can spark interest or joy in activities that once held so much allure. The weight of feeling down, depressed, and hopeless frequently presses heavily on this person's shoulders, making the simple act of facing a new day seem arduous.  Sleep has eluded this person, who finds it difficult to either fall or stay asleep; on other days, who sleeps too much. Yet despite the hours spent with eyes closed, this person wakes up feeling perpetually tired and lacking energy. It's a struggle just to get through a single day, and this person often feels too weary to engage with the world around.  The challenge of maintaining a steady appetite has also been present nearly every day. Occasionally, this person loses all interest in food, but at other times finds comfort in overeating, unable to establish a nurturing balance. Almost every day, an overwhelming wave of guilt and self-criticism crashes over this person. The belief that being a failure or a disappointment to oneself and to loved ones ebbs and flows, but it is a constant, unwelcome companion.  Concentration has become elusive, turning once-simple tasks like reading the newspaper or watching television into daunting endeavors. At times, this person moves or speaks so slowly that others might notice, though the sluggish pace is one more reminder of feeling out of sync with the world.   Despite the pervasive bleakness and struggles, this person has never entertained thoughts of wishing to be better off dead or of self-harm. This individual continues to navigate through the challenging days, hoping for change and seeking moments of light amidst the shadows.",first,"Over the past two weeks, I have found the world increasingly gray and uninviting.

Each sunrise offers little motivation, as the usual activities that once sparked interest now feel burdensome and hollow. More often than not, an oppressive cloud of sadness and hopelessness lingers, wrapping this person in its embrace and refusing to let go.   As night falls, the struggle continues. Sleep, which should offer respite, becomes a battle in itself – whether in the form of restless nights, marked by tossing and turning, or the unshakeable heaviness of oversleeping. Despite the abundance of rest or lack thereof, this person finds energy elusive, with fatigue settling in like a constant companion.   Some days come with an additional burden—the burden of self-doubt and guilt. On those days, the weight of past actions and perceived failures feels crushing, as if this person has disappointed not only themselves but also those around them.   Tasks that necessitate focus become daunting challenges, as concentration ebbs and flows like an unreliable tide. The simple joy of reading a newspaper or following a television show fades, leaving in its place a frustrating haze. With time, even the pace of movement and speech becomes an unwitting reflection of the internal struggle, slowing to a point where the change is perhaps apparent to others.
