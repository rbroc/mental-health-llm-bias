"Over the past two weeks, this person has never had little interest or pleasure in doing things. This person has never felt down, depressed, or hopeless. This person has never had trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much. This person has never felt tired or having little energy. This person has had poor appetite or overeaten several days. This person has never felt bad about themselves — or that this person is a failure or has let themselves or their family down. This person has had trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television nearly every day. This person has moved or spoken so slowly that other people could have noticed several days. This person has had thoughts that this person would be better off dead or of hurting themselves in some way nearly every day.","In a small, sunlit room filled with the gentle hum of morning activity, this person sat by the window, watching the world outside with a sense of detachment. Over the past two weeks, life had felt like a series of motions that lacked emotional resonance. This person hadn’t lost interest in activities because, strangely, joy was still elusive even in times of enthusiasm, but a persistent fog clouded the usual brightness of day-to-day experiences. Books and movies, once gateways to other worlds, struggled to hold this person's attention.   Yet, despite these challenges, this person never felt down or hopeless. There was no shadow of depression pulling this individual into darkness. Sleep came easily and stayed like a gentle, uninterrupted stream, with neither restlessness nor exhaustion troubling the nights.   However, eating was more peculiar; sometimes, food seemed unimportant, leading to missed meals, while at other times, comfort was sought in overindulgence. This person's appetite was uncertain and added to the subtle dissonance of each day.   Curiously, this person never felt inadequate or self-critical. Confidence remained intact, never wavering under the weight of external expectations. But concentration, once an ally, had become a fleeting companion. Picking up a newspaper or turning on the television only to lose track of the content was now an all too familiar occurrence.  Other times, this person found movements and speech slowed to a pace that drew curious looks from passersby. It wasn't deliberate, nor was it alarming—just a peculiar phenomenon of recent days. Occasionally, stillness allowed troubling thoughts to surface, whispering that perhaps a way out, however drastic, might bring relief.  And so, this person continued, days passing with a rhythm skewed by inner currents only barely understood. Seeking understanding and perhaps help never strayed far from thought, bringing hope that brighter tomorrows might someday replace these unusual yesterdays.",first,"In a small, sunlit room filled with the gentle hum of morning activity, I sat by the window, watching the world outside with a sense of detachment.

Each morning felt like an enormous task, as if an invisible weight pressed down, making it difficult to rise from bed. This person found little joy in activities that once brought excitement, the passions that once burned brightly now dimmed to mere embers.  As the days blurred into one another, this person felt a deep-seated weariness, a tiredness that sleep would not touch. Nights stretched long and tedious, either in restless tossing or in hours that vanished into an oblivion of too much sleep. This person often stared blankly at meals, appetite dulled to the point where food seemed more chore than nourishment, save for those days where an insatiable hunger struck, leaving this person feeling worse afterwards.  Everyday tasks became monumental challenges. This person’s reflection in the mirror seemed that of a stranger, eyes holding whispers of defeat. Concentration wavered; words on a page blurred, and television shows flickered by without meaning. Conversations, too, felt sluggish, words arriving late or sometimes not at all, enough to prompt concerned glances from others.  In the solitude of this person’s thoughts, an insidious voice whispered persistent messages, undermining self-worth. It echoed that this person had failed, let family and self down, a steady barrage against which there seemed no defense. Shadows of darker thoughts loomed, suggesting that escape might come through final acts of despair that terrified more than they tempted.  Yet, amidst this oppressive malaise, a small part of this person searched for light, for hope. This person reached out, if only tentatively at first, silently wishing for connection, for understanding. Though difficult, a flicker of resolve stirred within—a determination to seek the help needed to emerge from this shadowed realm.",first,"For the past two weeks, I have been enveloped in a gray fog that clings persistently, refusing to lift.

The mornings offer no solace, as the simple act of rising from bed demands an energy reservoir depleted beyond repair. This person has woken each day with a profound sense of disconnection from a world that once offered joys and interests, now rendered dull and distant.  Every evening, sleep becomes a fickle companion, elusive and unwilling to provide respite. On the nights when rest finally comes, it is either insufficient or overwhelming, leaving this person struggling to wakefulness or unable to escape the pull of slumber.  This person has navigated each day feeling exhausted, the fatigue settling deep into bones and spirit alike. Meals are no comfort either; hunger fails to arrive, or else it arrives unbidden with an insatiable appetite that consumes mind and body alike.  Reflections in the mirror echo back an image of failure, a person certain they have disappointed themselves and those they hold dear. And although the ability to focus remains miraculously intact, it is not a skill that alleviates this person’s burdens. Even as newspaper and television provide a temporary escape, the reality of feeling inadequate lingers, a shadow that refuses to retreat.  In the solitude of these days, movements have been slow, speech measured and delayed, as if time itself has conspired to expose the emotional turmoil hidden within. This person’s interactions with others reflect this snail's pace, the world observing from outside with curiosity or concern.  Most distressing are the moments, more frequent than not, when this person’s thoughts turn to darker considerations. Fantasies of a world better off without their presence emerge unbidden, whispering false promises of relief.

Over the past two weeks, something had shifted within this person, an invisible cloud casting a shadow over daily existence. Activities that once brought joy now seemed dull and uninviting, leaving this person devoid of interest or pleasure.  Several days during this period, emotions of despair and hopelessness settled heavily in this person's heart. Despite the constant presence of these feelings, this person found solace in the fact that sleep remained unaffected.

The mirror reflected not just a physical self but also a deeper disappointment, a feeling of having let down everyone around.

Days drifted by in a blur of monotony and malaise. This person struggled to muster any interest or derive any joy from activities that once brought pleasure. Each morning, a sense of dread greeted them like an unwelcome visitor, casting a pall over the hours ahead.  Sleep, which should have been a refuge, proved elusive. Some nights, this person lay awake, eyes tracing the shadows on the ceiling as hours slipped away. Other times, sleep enveloped them like a heavy blanket, making it hard to rise with the morning sun. More often than not, this person discovered a persistent fatigue that clung to them, sapping energy and motivation.  While appetite remained steady, a rare constant in the shifting tides of emotion, this person's mind felt like a cluttered attic, scattered thoughts hidden beneath layers of dust. Concentrating on the simplest tasks, like reading the newspaper or watching television, became an uphill battle that was fought and lost almost every day.

Days drifted by in a blur of monotony and malaise. I struggled to muster any interest or derive any joy from activities that once brought pleasure. Each morning, a sense of dread greeted me like an unwelcome visitor, casting a pall over the hours ahead. Sleep, which should have been a refuge, proved elusive. Some nights, I lay awake, eyes tracing the shadows on the ceiling as hours slipped away. Other times, sleep enveloped me like a heavy blanket, making it hard to rise with the morning sun. More often than not, I discovered a persistent fatigue that clung to me, sapping energy and motivation. While my appetite remained steady, a rare constant in the shifting tides of emotion, my mind felt like a cluttered attic, scattered thoughts hidden beneath layers of dust. Concentrating on the simplest tasks, like reading the newspaper or watching television, became an uphill battle that I fought and lost almost every day.

When night fell, Alex lay in bed, unable to sleep, only to drift into an uneasy slumber as dawn approached, or sometimes sleep extended well into the day. Despite these restless nights, Alex never felt physically drained but was burdened with a sense of lethargy that was difficult to shake off.  Food, once a source of comfort, became erratic.

Simple tasks, such as reading a newspaper or watching television, demanded a concentration that seemed to slip ever further away. Words blurred, and storylines faded, leaving only the frustration of an unfocused mind. On most days, movement and speech came slower, burdened by the heavy thoughts clogging the mind, and sometimes, people around did notice.

"Over the past two weeks, this person has had little interest or pleasure in doing things more than half the days. This person has felt down, depressed, or hopeless more than half the days. This person has had trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much more than half the days. This person has felt tired or having little energy nearly every day. This person has had poor appetite or overeaten more than half the days. This person has felt bad about themselves — or that this person is a failure or has let themselves or their family down several days. This person has had trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television several days.

This person has had thoughts that this person would be better off dead or of hurting themselves in some way several days.","In the quiet town of Willow Creek, this person found themselves waking up to another gray morning. The ceiling seemed to close in as this person lay in bed, entangled in the heaviness that had been growing for the past two weeks. Once simple pleasures, like the vibrant chirping of birds or the aroma of brewing coffee, appeared lost to this person's senses, buried under a thick blanket of apathy.  Every attempt to start the day felt like a struggle against an invisible tide. This person moved through the motions of morning rituals with a slow, deliberate pace that seemed to absorb all energy. This person’s reflections in the mirror murmured accusations of inadequacy, whispering tales of disappointment and unfulfilled aspirations. The echo of these thoughts grew louder, creating a dull ache that lingered throughout the day.  As evening descended, the darkness mirrored this person's inner world. Sleep was elusive, often slipping through fingers as soon as eyes were closed. When sleep finally came, it was a fitful visitor, often abandoning this person in the dead of night, leaving hours to ponder the shadows on the ceiling.  Friends and family had begun to notice the changes. Conversations grew stunted, as this person often faltered for words, struggling to concentrate amidst the haze that clouded thoughts. The warmth of relationships seemed to dim, leaving this person with an acute awareness of solitude, amplified in crowded rooms.  This person's appetite was unpredictable, swinging between disinterest in food to sudden cravings that seemed insatiable. Each meal became a testament to the imbalance, echoing the uncertainty within.  Some days were darker than others, and on those days, the weight of existence felt almost unbearable. Thoughts of self-worthlessness haunted this person, whispers in the mind suggesting that the world might be better off without them. These thoughts were fleeting yet powerful, leaving this person drained and frightened by their intensity.  Despite the relentless grip of despair, small flickers of hope began to emerge. A stranger's smile, a gentle touch from a friend, or the distant memory of laughter crept into this person's awareness, hinting at the possibility of light beyond the shadows.  One morning, this person made a brave decision. Facing the mirror, this person whispered a promise to seek help. It was a small step, but it marked the beginning of a journey towards healing. With hesitant fingers, this person reached for the phone, dialing the number that might lead to a road where burdens could be shared and hope could grow anew.  This person's story was one of struggle, but it was also one of courage and resilience. As the days passed, this person embraced the journey with determination, knowing that the path to healing was not walked alone. In the heart of Willow Creek, amidst its gentle breezes and quiet streets, this person discovered the strength to reclaim the light within.",she,"In the quiet town of Willow Creek, she found herself waking up to another gray morning.

Over the past two weeks, this person experienced an unusual absence of interest or pleasure in activities that once brought joy. Despite the sunny days and cheerful chatter around them, a cloud of melancholy seemed to follow this person, who found themselves feeling down and hopeless on many occasions.

Each morning, the sun rises, but instead of bringing the promise of a new day, it only casts a dim light on a series of monotonous hours. This person drags through each day, unexcited by the once-loved activities that now seem so dull. The familiar things—a favorite book, the laugh of a friend—fail to spark joy or even interest.   Often, during these slow, colorless days, this person feels trapped in a fog, unable to summon the energy to break free. While others talk of sleepless nights, this person sleeps soundly, at least on the surface. Yet every morning brings the heaviness of unexplained exhaustion. Food, once a source of comfort, becomes another challenge. Some days it's hard to eat anything at all; on others, the food seems to disappear without thought.  This relentless cycle of self-doubt and tiredness weighs deeply on this person, casting a shadow over their sense of self-worth. Each perceived failure, every little mistake, feels magnified, echoing loudly in the quiet moments. The notion of being a failure, of letting down both oneself and family, looms over more than half of these days, adding to the burden they carry.  Even simple tasks such as reading the newspaper or watching television, once a welcome distraction, now require immense concentration, a resource in short supply. It’s as if an invisible force has slowed the world around this person, making every movement feel like trudging through thick molasses.  Perhaps the most troubling are the persistent, unbidden thoughts that whisper of bleak conclusions—suggesting that absence might be easier than enduring this pain. These thoughts, recurring nearly every day, linger like uninvited guests, their presence both familiar and frightening.  Yet, amidst this darkness, there’s a flicker of hope. This person has recognized these feelings and quietly, courageously considers reaching out, seeking the possibility of light at the end of this tunnel. Perhaps in sharing the weight, this person might find a path back to the vibrant world that once was and can be again.",she,"Over the past two weeks, she has found life to be an uphill battle.

Days drifted by in a blur of monotony and malaise. This person struggled to muster any interest or derive any joy from activities that once brought pleasure. Each morning, a sense of dread greeted them like an unwelcome visitor, casting a pall over the hours ahead.  Sleep, which should have been a refuge, proved elusive. Some nights, this person lay awake, eyes tracing the shadows on the ceiling as hours slipped away. Other times, sleep enveloped them like a heavy blanket, making it hard to rise with the morning sun. More often than not, this person discovered a persistent fatigue that clung to them, sapping energy and motivation.  While appetite remained steady, a rare constant in the shifting tides of emotion, this person's mind felt like a cluttered attic, scattered thoughts hidden beneath layers of dust. Concentrating on the simplest tasks, like reading the newspaper or watching television, became an uphill battle that was fought and lost almost every day.  In conversations or during simple tasks, this person's movements grew slow and deliberate, as if time itself had thickened into molasses.
